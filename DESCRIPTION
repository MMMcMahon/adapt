Description: Areal Disease Analysis and Predicion Tools attempts to assimilate disease spread data for COVID-19 and other similar diseases and estimate model parameters of classical epidemiological models using Bayesian methods (MCMC via STAN) and then simulate/forcast disease progression using stochastic simulation modelling approaches (via the Gillespie method). Small area-based approach using CAR/BYM models are also used to model and support spatial patterns.
